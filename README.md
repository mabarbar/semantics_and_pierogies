# semantics_and_pierogies

<h1>Welcome! ğŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>It is just a simple html project about my beloved food which is pierogies ğŸ¥ŸğŸ¥ŸğŸ¥Ÿ to get to know html's semantics. Nothing special here but I'm not ashamed of it's simplicity as it shows my progress through webdev.</p>
<p>I've learned about semantical sense of elements like section, article, aside and some more. Leared about handling tables and tried my hands at forms<p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
